# Mattermost Interview process project

### Stage 1

This project serves as a base for the first stage of the interview process at Mattermost.

Take this opportunity to inspect the code, run the project and try to debug and fix the issues you find in this existing project built with React Native.
During your interview you will need to answer questions about how you found the bugs you found, what the reasons behind your specific fixes are, and why you decided some particular working code needed improvement.

### Goal
1. Be able to run the project
2. Identify and fix bugs
3. Improve performance when possible
4. Do **not** spend more than 2 hours

#### Instructions
1. Clone this repository. (**do not fork it**)
2. With your own GitHub account, create a public repository containing the code you cloned in step 1 and name it \<firstname-lastname-movies\>.
3. Notify the interviewer by sending them a link to your repository.
4. Start your debugging session and fix everything you are able to find.
5. Commit the changes to **your** repository.
6. Prepare for the interview and have your camera on ;).

#### Pro tip
* You'll notice the animated transitions in the app are not very smooth. The animation itself is *not* the problem.
